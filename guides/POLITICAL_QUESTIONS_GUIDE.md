## 🤖 **How the AI Responds to Subjective Questions**

When you ask a subjective question, the AI will:

1. **Acknowledge the subjectivity** in your question
2. **Provide objective facts** it can determine from the data
3. **Suggest alternative approaches** for analysis
4. **Remain politically neutral** in its response
5. **Focus on measurable metrics** rather than interpretations

## 💡 **Tips for Better Political Analysis**

### **1. Focus on Actions, Not Intentions**
- Instead of asking about political motivations, ask about actual legislative actions
- Look at voting records, sponsorship patterns, and bill content

### **2. Use Specific Policy Areas**
- Rather than broad political terms, focus on specific issues like "healthcare," "immigration," or "defense"

### **3. Ask for Comparisons**
- "Compare Republican vs. Democratic activity on climate bills"
- "Show differences in healthcare approaches by party"

### **4. Request Timeline Analysis**
- "How has immigration legislation changed over time?"
- "What policy areas were most active in 2024 vs. 2025?"

### **5. Seek Pattern Recognition**
- "Which policy areas have the most bipartisan support?"
- "What topics generate the most legislative activity?"

## 🎯 **Example Conversation Flow**

### **User:** "How many bills make Trump look good?"

### **AI Response:**
"I notice your question contains subjective language. Instead of determining what makes someone 'look good' (which is subjective), I can provide objective analysis:

- **Bills mentioning Trump:** 3 found
- **Nature of references:** Primarily focused on peace-making and diplomacy
- **Bill types:** All resolutions (ceremonial rather than substantive)
- **Timeline:** All introduced in October 2025

Would you like me to analyze:
- Bills that mention Trump's specific policies?
- Resolutions praising any political figure?
- Legislative activity related to Trump's policy agenda?"
