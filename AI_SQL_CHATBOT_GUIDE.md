## 📈 **Real Performance Examples**

### **State Analysis Query**
```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) as republican_count 
FROM members 
WHERE party_abbreviation = 'R' 
  AND chamber = 'house' 
  AND current_member = true 
GROUP BY state 
ORDER BY republican_count DESC 
LIMIT 10
```
**Result**: 15 records in milliseconds

### **Bipartisan Analysis Query**
```sql
WITH party_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    b.id, b.title,
    SUM(CASE WHEN bc.party = 'D' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as dem_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN bc.party = 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as rep_count
  FROM bills b
  JOIN bill_cosponsors bc ON b.id = bc.bill_id
  GROUP BY b.id, b.title
  HAVING dem_count > 0 AND rep_count > 0
)
SELECT * FROM party_counts 
ORDER BY ABS(dem_count - rep_count), (dem_count + rep_count) DESC
```
**Result**: Complex bipartisan analysis in seconds
